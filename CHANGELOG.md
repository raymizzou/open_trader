# Changelog

Every push to `main` must add one dated entry here. Keep entries short and
operator-facing: what changed, which workflow is affected, and what was verified.

## 2026-07-12

- Added a mandatory `make acceptance` Dashboard gate with PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED
  results across tests, real data, refresh stability, process version, logs,
  and desktop/mobile Chrome flows; fixed OTHER holdings breaking Dashboard loads
  and Tiger refreshes converting preserved CN rows to OTHER. The gate now also
  checks the full 33-row portfolio, seven Phillips-linked rows, and the exact
  Eastmoney statement total; live broker refreshes fail closed and restore the
  prior CSV if they would remove another broker's holdings.
- Added password-prompted Eastmoney A-share statement imports using an explicit
  month-end CNY/HKD rate, plus AKShare daily prices for standard-strategy research.
- Kept the Dashboard holdings layout unchanged while adding the existing A-share
  market and Eastmoney broker filters.
- Added one global dashboard workspace for read-only standard-strategy research
  across current holdings and watchlist symbols, with trend-pullback,
  breakout-momentum, and range-mean-reversion strategies.
- Added buy-and-hold and market-index comparisons, explicit actual data dates,
  fixed cost and sizing assumptions, and standalone auditable artifacts.
- Preserved real nonzero Futu daily volume for breakout research and fixed the
  price/action chart to render the serialized close-price series.
- Verified with `192` focused and `1134` full pytest tests, three fresh real 1Y
  MSFT/Futu API runs with 320 positive-volume MSFT and SPY rows, and separate
  Playwright submissions for all three strategies proving visible equity,
  price-path, and action-marker geometry with no console or network errors.

## 2026-07-11

- Added a dashboard backtest price-sync status line so operators can see when
  automatic price backfill succeeds or fails during page load.

## 2026-07-10

- Added a dashboard action to fetch missing backtest price CSVs from Futu daily
  K-line data and refresh the per-holding backtest readiness state.
- Marked sell-side, hold, and underweight trading plans as unsupported by the
  first buy-side backtest engine instead of showing misleading missing fields.
- Added sell-side trading-plan backtests for underweight/reduce/trim/sell
  ratings, seeded from current dashboard holding quantity and verified through
  pytest plus a local dashboard click check.
- Added a dashboard backtest-status filter so operators can isolate holdings
  that are ready to run, missing prices, missing plan fields, or unsupported.
- Added live counts to the dashboard backtest-status filter, scoped by the
  current market and broker filters.
- Made dashboard loads automatically fetch missing backtest daily K-line price
  CSVs through Futu so operators do not need to manually fill price data first.
- Removed the manual backtest price-fetch button from the dashboard detail view;
  missing price data is now handled by automatic dashboard loading.

## 2026-07-09

- Added a read-only `run-backtest` MVP for active trading-plan rows, producing
  trades, equity curve, metrics, and Markdown report artifacts without updating
  `data/latest` or placing orders.
- Added dashboard backtest entry buttons that open a per-holding回测详情 view
  without showing backtest metrics on the main holdings table.
- Added a dashboard-only backtest run action that uses the local latest trading
  plan and `data/prices/<market>/<symbol>.csv`, then refreshes the detail view.
- Added dashboard backtest readiness details so operators can see missing plan
  fields and price CSV paths before running a backtest.
- Documented the first backtest workflow in both READMEs.
- Verified with focused backtest/dashboard pytest coverage, the full pytest
  suite, and a local dashboard click check on `127.0.0.1:8766`.

## 2026-07-04

- Added Futu daily-K Bollinger fact generation for dashboard K-line cards, fixed
  Futu/Tiger live-sync asset-class inference for type-less positions, and
  removed the duplicate technical-fact grid from those cards after live
  dashboard verification across all current HK/US eligible holdings.
- Added a fixed Bollinger-band display in the dashboard K-line card, with red
  upper-band risk, green lower-band opportunity, and neutral middle-range
  states.
- Backfilled Bollinger facts from real HK/US latest TradingAgents reports when
  model extraction fails, and verified the live dashboard renders those facts
  without `undefined`.
- Stabilized the daily HK/US premarket workflow around `portfolio.csv` holdings,
  report-symbol filtering, non-blocking facts/summary artifacts, configurable
  worker concurrency, and Feishu start/completion notifications.
- Verified with the full pytest suite and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-07-03

- Added holdings-table 做T signal details with fixed ratio sizing, signal
  evidence, precondition checks, notification timeline, and session-gated pulse
  highlighting.
- Enabled HK 做T signal generation through Futu realtime subscriptions for
  1-minute K lines, 5-minute K lines, and order book data.
- Changed 做T Feishu alerts to one structured Chinese message per symbol with
  action, ratio, status, conclusion, numbered evidence, and timestamp.
- Verified with the full pytest suite, Playwright against the local dashboard,
  live HK Futu signal generation, and a real Feishu app notification send.

## 2026-07-02

- Reworked the dashboard holdings table around the operator fields: quantity,
  cost price, live price, USD/HKD market value, portfolio weight, and P/L.
- Split holdings into `美股正股`, `美股期权`, `港股正股`, and `港股期权`
  sections, kept each section sorted by portfolio weight, and kept broker
  context inside the trading decision detail.
- Added the Futu anomaly signal card to the trading decision detail so
  technical, capital-flow, and derivatives anomaly signals display in Chinese
  without leaking raw enum/schema text.
- Verified with focused dashboard/Futu facts pytest, live local dashboard
  deployment on `127.0.0.1:8766`, and Playwright checks for section order,
  section weight sorting, detail expansion, and the anomaly signal card.

## 2026-07-01

- Fixed Phillips statement parsing for `UT OTCU` money-market-fund rows so the
  Phillip HKD Money Market Fund is included in monthly holdings refreshes.
- Refreshed the local Phillips monthly baseline from the 2026-06 statement and
  verified live Futu/Tiger sync preserves the updated statement rows.
- Verified with focused parser/account-sync tests and dashboard API checks for
  `2026-06 月结单导入`.

## 2026-06-30

- Canonicalized `portfolio.csv` grouping so daily HK/US workflows consume
  deduplicated current holdings instead of repeated broker rows.
- Hardened Futu and Tiger portfolio sync merges, including malformed cash rows,
  stale Tiger FX rows, mixed-broker fallback safety, and multi-broker cash detail
  preservation.
- Stabilized daily startup by clearing successful run locks and adding bounded
  OpenAI-compatible request timeouts for classifier, facts, and TradingAgents
  summary post-processing.
- Added blocker notifications when TradingAgents advice, trading plans, or
  summaries degrade to fallback/error so missing US reports are visible to the
  operator.
- Verified with live Futu/Tiger syncs, `data/latest/portfolio.csv` duplicate
  count `0`, US daily runner `success / ready`, local dashboard deployment on
  `127.0.0.1:8766`, Playwright desktop/mobile checks, and `832` passing tests.

## 2026-06-23

- Added fixed TradingAgents decision facts for dashboard display:
  `趋势 / K 线` uses `趋势`, `位置`, `动能`, `关键位`, `风险`;
  `新闻 / 舆论` uses `方向`, `变化`, `催化`, `风险`, `热度`.
- Added LLM extraction and validation for `decision_facts.json`, with per-module
  fallback to `缺失` when a module cannot be extracted safely.
- Wired decision facts into the daily premarket pipeline and dashboard payload,
  including source-hash freshness checks.
- Updated the local dashboard cards so missing fixed fields show `缺失` instead
  of explanatory filler or raw English TradingAgents prose.
- Documented local dashboard deployment on port `8766` and added structured API
  checks for `SOXX` decision facts.
